This repository is related to the paper "Seeking Common but Distinguishing Difference, A Joint Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis Model" on [EMNLP2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.318/), and it is based on the work of [Wang and Lu (2020)](https://github.com/LorrinWWW/two-are-better-than-one). We appreciate them a lot for their help and support to this work.\
Because I am busy with the graduation preparation recently, this repository is still building, and I will upload our source codes as soon as possible.
